        "This book explores deeper questions of life, reflects on the essence of Ultimate Truth (reality), and suggests leading a balanced life amidst the complexities and constant changes of our world. It encourages adopting a moderate approach, with one hand reaching for the Ultimate Truth and the other engaged with the tangible world.",
        "Mankuthimmana Kagga fascinated me the first time I read it at school. I wished to revisit it and share some snippets, but I couldn't find it online. This led me to create this website. This treasure should be accessible to all and shouldn't be hidden.",
        "The content for this site was sourced from books and websites, and all credit goes to the original authors and publishers.",
        "I earn no money from this website and did this out of gratitude for DVG's craft.",
        "I hope these Kagga's change your outlook towards life, as it did to mine!",
        "Please buy the book to support the publishers, printers, editors and authors!",
